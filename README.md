IFA_BOT is a bot that we have created for the sole purpose of being used on our discord server

## Features
* Metar information by using **prefix** + **metar** + **ICAO**
* Weather information by using **prefix** + **weather** + **location**
* Delete messages by using **prefix** + **purge** + **number of messages**
* Welcomes user in the ```#welcome``` channel and in DM's when they join and gives them the ```Member``` and ```Unverified Pilot``` roles
* Plays music by using **prefix** + **music** + **command** + **link or search term**

More to come in the future as this bot is being continually developed

## Plans for Near Future
* Vatsim information such as ATC online
* Possibly server moderation
* Maybe extending the bot to other servers..?
